# GuessWhat: Audio Classification IoT for the Hearing Impaired

The **GuessWhat** project consists of a distributed system for classifying sounds captured by the BitDogLab board's microphone. The target audience primarily includes individuals with hearing impairments, who can benefit from receiving descriptions of the surrounding sounds. BitDogLab is a development kit that includes a Raspberry Pi Pico W, also known as the RP2040.

The GuessWhat system is capable of capturing 3-second audio snippets, sending them via Wi-Fi to a server, which then pre-processes the sound and returns a classification â€” for example, whether the sound is speech, music, crying, or animal noise.
